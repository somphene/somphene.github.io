Here's some of the course projects done by me at IIT Bombay. All of these required extensive reading of literature and devotion of significant time throughout the semester(s). In fact some of them turned out as products of thinking and working on similar ideas over a year or more. 

## Plasmonics
* Extraordinary transmission in Plasmonic Microlens.
* Analyzing transmission of plasmonic microlens in square gold plate using Lumerical FDTD simulations.

## Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
* Understanding First Principles approach to simulating materials.
* Performing Density Functional Theory based IR and Raman spectrum calculations using Quantum Espresso.
* Thermoelectric Properties of Doped Mg2Si using VASP, BoltzTrap.

## Rashba Spin Orbit Coupling in Graphene and Zigzag Nanoribbons 
### Introduction to Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (EP 425), Prof. Anshuman Kumar, Dept. of Physics 
* Reproduced plots from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.0160.pdf) using  Matlab and presented ([Slides](http://home.iitb.ac.in/~15d110001/RashbaSOCZigzag.pdf)) their analysis.
