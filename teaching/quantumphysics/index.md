This course introduces basic concepts which are heavily used in quantum mechanical calculations for engineering requirements. Nanotechnology has become so pervasive that building familiarity with quantum mechanics has become inevitable for any working engineer. Apart from heavy applications, this subject is a pure delight to study in itself because its nothing like the physics that we have encountered before our freshmen year. Breaking intuition and moving beyond limits of understanding our familiar world is key to understanding this subject.
