Students in my tutorial batch may refer to the live [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10l6oqrUJ1mfamFQIl7sz8On1pi-cwkyVZKzeHKpMflk/edit) which I maintain for this course. This document is constructed almost entirely out of interactions with students in my tutorial batch: their doubts and from discussing approaches to solving the tutorial sheets of MA 105. Other students may consult their own Teaching Assistants before refering to the above document. Those who are here just to learn the subject, may proceed as they wish.  

[Notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DC2bB8ZvCodoGofQPYb0SOyWpCfZ986Y/view?usp=sharing) will be uploaded as the course proceeds.
