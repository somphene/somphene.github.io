Please visit Prof. Gopal Krishna Srinivasan's [homepage](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~gopal/) for the updated version of the [notes](). I was the teaching assistant for this course when he was the instructor and the effort he has put into creating these notes is unparalleled. I mostly followed the notes while teaching, including some applications more pertinent to engineers time and again.
