Please visit Prof. Gopal Krishna Srinivasan's [homepage](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~gopal/) for the updated version of the [notes](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~gopal/MA108/ma108_handwritten_notes_2008.pdf). When he was the instructor, the effort he put into creating these notes is unparalleled. I mostly followed the notes while teaching, including some applications more pertinent to engineers time and again.
