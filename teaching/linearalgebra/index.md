Students in my tutorial batch may please refer to the live [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jhy6ZHGB3szabLlQZEkjoA7RQ422hIL5Ct_5enga34E/edit) which I maintain for the course MA 106 Linear Algebra, IIT Bombay. This document is constructed almost entirely out of interactions with students in my tutorial batch and their doubts from discussing approaches to solving the tutorial sheets of MA 106. Other students may consult their own Teaching assistants before refering to the above document. Those who are here just to learn the subject, may proceed as they wish.
