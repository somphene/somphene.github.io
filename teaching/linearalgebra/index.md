Students in my tutorial batch may please refer to the live [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jhy6ZHGB3szabLlQZEkjoA7RQ422hIL5Ct_5enga34E/edit) which I maintain for the course MA 106 Linear Algebra, IIT Bombay. This document is constructed almost entirely out of interactions with students in my tutorial batch and their doubts from discussing approaches to solving the tutorial sheets of MA 106. Other students may consult their own Teaching assistants before refering to the above document. Those who are here just to learn the subject, may proceed as they wish.  

This is the document from last year [Linear Algebra, MA 106](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQT5-M2Gg4yGKblm7CBXUswg-9XiKuYwl4ibBLjfzmfwQtnTDVuBmxjFYGeg-1PF883Qozthtb88cGO/pub). 
Last year, TAs were given independence to set their own grading scheme for 5 marks, I decided to take a test every week and three group activities for which the following papers were prepared by me. Post test two,all questions can be found in the document linked above.
