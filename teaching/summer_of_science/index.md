I have been a mentor for Summer of Science (SOS) of Maths and Physics Club for the last three years.

I was fortunate to interact with many bright students who were extremely committed to their project throughout the summer. Here are some of the best project reports:
* Summer 2019 Adway Girish [Classical Field Theory], Misari Bhanani [Differential Geometry in Structural Geology]
* Summer 2018 Chaitanya Kumar [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](/chaitanya_sos_report.pdf)
* Summer 2017 Bhavya Garg [Transition Metal Compounds]
