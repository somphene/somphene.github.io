I have been a mentor for Summer of Science (SOS) of Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay for the last three summers.

I have been fortunate to interact with many bright students who were extremely committed to their project throughout the summer. Here are some of the project reports:
* Summer 2019 [Classical Field Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WBdpV_owNOXtm_H4Ymgj7egU9Xh_OYDJ/view?usp=sharing) by Adway Girish, [Differential Geometry in Structural Geology](/diffgeoinstructgeo.pdf) by Misari Bhanani 
* Summer 2018 [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](/chaitanya_sos_report.pdf) by Chaitanya Kumar
* Summer 2017 [Transition Metal Compounds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1eeAcosneKFc3RhSklXa2ROeE0/view?usp=drive_open) by Bhavya Garg
