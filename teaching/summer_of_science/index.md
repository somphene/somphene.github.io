I have been a mentor for Summer of Science (SOS) of Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay for the last three summers.

I was fortunate to interact with many bright students who were extremely committed to their project throughout the summer. Here are some of the best project reports:
* Summer 2019 Adway Girish [Classical Field Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WBdpV_owNOXtm_H4Ymgj7egU9Xh_OYDJ/view?usp=sharing), Misari Bhanani [Differential Geometry in Structural Geology](/diffgeoinstructgeo.pdf)
* Summer 2018 Chaitanya Kumar [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](/chaitanya_sos_report.pdf)
* Summer 2017 Bhavya Garg [Transition Metal Compounds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1eeAcosneKFc3RhSklXa2ROeE0/view?usp=drive_open)
